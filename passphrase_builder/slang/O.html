<font size=3><b>oy vay: </b></font> It comes from a language called Yiddish which was spoken by European Jews. <br>It is a mixture of Hebrew, German and various Slavic languages. <br>Prior to WWII about eleven million people spoke Yiddish; <br>newspapers and books were published in the language, and there was Yiddish theater in Europe, <br>the United States and Latin America. <br>Oy! can mean any number of things, depending on the context and the way it is said. <br>It can express both dejection and joy; ecstasy and horror. <br>Oy Vay literally means oh pain, but it is often used to express just the opposite. A<br> book entitled The Joys of Yiddish by Leo Rosten lists 29 ways the expression Oy! can be used.
